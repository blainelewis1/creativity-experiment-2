Your decision to participate is voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time. You are not required to answer any questions you do not feel comfortable answering. You are not required to complete any task you do not feel comfortable completing. There will be no negative consequences for withdrawing or not completing any tasks or questions. There are no conditions for the withdrawal of your data if you do chose to withdraw.\n  \nI understand the following:  \n - The purpose of the study is to understand the use of user input sensing and display technologies in supporting various tasks.  \n - I will be asked to participate in an experiment requiring me to provide input to a computer using professional and consumer-grade sensing and display devices.  \n - I have been asked to participate as someone who would exhibit typical behaviors with interactive technologies.  \n - I will be participating in remote experiments lasting hours.  \n - The study will take place remotely, at a convenient location of my choosing  \n - The researchers do not foresee any risks or stresses beyond what one might experience in day-to-day living and interacting with consumer electronics devices.  \n - By participating in this study I will have the opportunity to experience cutting-edge research computing environment. No other direct benefits are associated with the study.  \n - I will be compensated a total of ==$NEED VALUE==.  \n - All data collected about me will be kept secure. In all data files, my name and identifying features will be removed and replaced with a code in order to preserve my confidentiality. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to the information I provide. The data collected will be destroyed 5 years after publication of results.\n - Video and audio recordings or frame grabs of the session may be used in published materials or in presentations of this research. I am free to consent or not consent to their usage without any negative consequences, as per the options provided below (check one option below).\n - Data collected may be used in research journals, conferences, or other scholarly activities. In these cases, my name will not be used and will be replaced with an identifier (e.g., Participant 1) and no identifying information will be provided to the audience. \n - I do not meet any of the exclusion criteria of the study â€“ I am 18-60 years old, have normal or corrected to normal vision, and no major physical impairments.\n - I am free to ask questions about the process at any time. I can ask questions in person, or by contacting Tovi Grossman at [tovi@dgp.toronto.edu](mailto:tovi@dgp.toronto.edu) or by telephone at 416-978-6763.  \n - If requested, I will receive a copy of this form for my records.  \n - To learn about publications arising from this work, I can visit: [https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi).  \n\nThe research study you are participating in may be reviewed for quality assurance to make sure that the required laws and guidelines are followed. If chosen, (a) representative(s) of the Human Research Ethics Program (HREP) may access study-related data and/or consent materials as part of the review. All information accessed by the HREP will be upheld to the same level of confidentiality that has been  \nstated by the research team. \n  \nIf you have any questions about your rights as a participant, please contact the Ethics Review Office at [ethics.review@utoronto.ca](mailto:ethics.review@utoronto.ca) or (416) 946-3273.","questions":[{"label":"I understand and consent to the above.","required":true},{"label":"Yes: Video and audio recordings or frame grabs of the session may be used.","required":false},{"label":"No: Video and audio recordings or frame grabs of the session may not be used.","required":false}],"logs":[{"type":"START","timestamp":1653548305434},{"type":"END","timestamp":1653548306614}]},{"task":"InformationScreen","content":"\nIn order to complete this experiment you will first be given a computer menu, and taught how to use it.
